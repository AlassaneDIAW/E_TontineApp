# Getting Started with E-TontineApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and customized for **E_TontineApp**.  
You can find the source code at [github.com/etontine/E_TontineApp](https://github.com/etontine/E_TontineApp).

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See more about [running tests](https://etontine.github.io/E_TontineApp/docs/running-tests).

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://etontine.github.io/E_TontineApp/docs/deployment) for more information.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.

> ⚠️ You are on your own after ejecting. Use with caution.
